The following repository shows the work of Group 5 during the H(n)MI Class. The Group consists of two MAA Students and a MAEBB Student. 

"Locked In" was the final project created for this workshop. The driving concept is to be used as a remote working study tool, one that helps change the enviornment around you through light and sound if you are not able to physically change locations. The changed enviornment would ideally help you refocus and study. The overall goal of this class was to acheive an interaction derived from ML5's hand gesture detection code, in which the model was trained to recognize certain gestures. Once these gestures were detected, through P5, embedded music files would play. P5 would then send data to Arduino to activate a new lighting array.
