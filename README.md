# H(n)MI Class - MDEF

Group Members: [Nathan Power](https://github.com/npower1-gif), [Aayushi Vasnik](https://github.com/vaschick), [Alfred Aramouni](https://github.com/khara7mar)

The following repository shows the work of Group 5 during the H(n)MI Class. The Group consists of two MAA Students and a MAEBB Student. 

## 11_02_experiments Folder 

This folder contains the experiments from the first day of H(n)MI when we worked with Arduino and Processing to connect a soft pressure sensor that we made from a piezo resistive material between two layers of conductive material.

## 14_02_experiments Folder

This folder contains the experiments from the third day of H(n)MI

## Small Data - "Lock In"
 
The concept of this project derives from the very easy distractability of student Nathan Power. The function of the sensor will be to wave your hand in front of a motion sensor to create an environmental change in sound and lighting to help refocus the user's attention.

Proposed code architecture: 
- Connet Arduino Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to lighting and sound units.
- Create setup within work enviornment in order to test conditions
